	<a name="history"><h2>History</h2></a>
	<p>Lighthouse Bible Church San Diego/San Jose started as a dream back in the mid-1980s when a group of students at UCLA started to dream about planting a church that would minister to the spiritual needs of second generation Korean-Americans. While there were numerous parachurch ministries on college campuses, there were very few churches that understood and ministered to the unique issues facing second generation Korean Americans.</p>
	<p>In 1996, Pastor John Kim, who was pastoring in Maryland at the time, prayed along with his wife Angela about planting a church in San Diego. A number of people were consulted to pray for this vision of planting a church, including several families that would have an instrumental role in the starting and developing of Lighthouse.</p>
	<p>Various circumstances caused this vision to be put on hold, but in the spring of 1998, it was renewed as several families started to meet together for prayer and planning of a church plant in San Diego. Over Mexican food every Wednesday night, these families prayed and fellowshipped as they started the humble beginnings of Lighthouse.</p>
	<p>July 15, 1998 saw the first Bible study begin at the home of Peter and Jinny Lim where fifteen people came together to study the gospel message. Our first Sunday service was on December 6 where we met upstairs at what was then Faith United Methodist Church. The official inaugural service took place on May 2, 1999 as Pastor Chris Mueller spoke to usher in Lighthouse Bible Church San Diego officially into the community.</p>
	<p>Since our modest beginning of around 30 people that first year, our church has grown tremendously as God has blessed us with many people from all over San Diego. From the military, to people moving to San Diego from out of town, to students in the surrounding college campuses, there are many backgrounds represented at LBCSD. God has also brought people from various ethnic backgrounds to bring a greater diversity to what was originally a predominantly Korean-American congregation. While we still see great opportunities to minister to the needs of second generation Korean-Americans, we see that God is also allowing us to reach out to everyone who needs to hear the good news of the gospel and grow in their faith.</p>
	<p>As we are committed to upholding a high view of God and His Word in all that we do, it is our great hope that God’s faithfulness would continue to show grace to us as a church body in standing true to God’s character and truth without apology or compromise. We have seen so many lives changed, especially those who had thought they were Christians but realized it was nothing more than just a name. We look forward to the years ahead as we seek to be faithful to God and His Word.</p>


	<a name="mvp"><h2>MVP</h2></a>
	<p>Here at LBC we desire to bring glory to God by eagerly following his commandments, both individually and collectively as a church family. In keeping with this we have three points of specific application summed up in what we call the “M.V.P. Statement,” representing our Mission, our Vision and our Passion. These three points are more than just a mantra, but it affects all aspects of our ministry at LBC.</p>
	
	<a name="mission"><h3>MISSION: TO MAKE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST</h3></a>
	<p>The MISSION of Lighthouse Bible Church is found in the Great Commission:
And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” ~Matthew 28:18-20</p>

	<a name="vision"><h3>VISION: TO PLANT CHURCHES</h3></a>
	<p>The VISION of Lighthouse Bible Church is that we would be used by God as a beacon of God’s truth and love not only locally in the San Jose community but also nationally and even internationally, especially through the avenue of church-planting. In this, we desire to be a church that is obedient to the Great Commission.
“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.” ~Acts 1:8</p>

	<a name="passion"><h3>PASSION: TO LOVE GOD AND PEOPLE</h3></a>
	<p>The vision and mission of Lighthouse Bible Church is to be accompanied by a PASSION stemming from a vibrant love relationship with God that reveals itself in a passion for God, His Word and will, and for His church and those He desires to save.
“And He said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.” ~ Matthew 22:37-40</p>


	<a name="statementoffaith"><h2>Statement of Faith</h2></a>
	
	<a name="holyscriptures"><h3>Holy Scriptures</h3></a>
	<p>We teach that the Bible is God`s written revelation to man, and thus the sixty-six books of the Bible given to us by the Holy Spirit constitute the plenary (inspired equally in all parts) Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:7-14; 2 Peter 1:20-21). We teach that the Word of God is an objective, propositional revelation (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 2:13), verbally inspired in every word (2 Timothy 3:16), absolutely inerrant in the original documents, infallible, and God-breathed. We teach the literal, grammatical-historical interpretation of Scripture which affirms the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17). We teach that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice (Matthew 5:18; 24:35; John 10:35; 16:12-13; 17:17; 1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Hebrews 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20-21). We teach that God spoke in His written Word by a process of dual authorship. The Holy Spirit so superintended the human authors that, through their individual personalities and different styles of writing, they composed and recorded God`s Word to man (2 Peter 1:20-21) without error in the whole or in the part (Matthew 5:18; 2Timothy 3:16). We teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal grammatical-historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (John 7:17; 16:12-15; 1Corinthians 2:7-15; 1 John 2:20). It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture, recognizing that proper application is binding on all generations. Yet the truth of Scripture stands in judgment of men; never do men stand in judgment of it. </p>
	
	<a name="god"><h3>God</h3></a>
	<p>We teach that there is but one living and true God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Corinthians 8:4), an infinite, all-knowing Spirit (John 4:24), perfect in all His attributes, one in essence, eternally existing in three Persons–Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14)–each equally deserving worship and obedience.</p>
	
	<a name="godthefather"><h4>God the Father</h4></a>
	<p>We teach that God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all things according to His own purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8-9; 1 Corinthians 8:6). He is the creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31; Ephesians 3:9). As the only absolute and omnipotent ruler in the universe, He is sovereign in creation, providence, and redemption (Psalm 103:19; Romans 11:36). His fatherhood involves both His designation within the Trinity and His relationship with mankind. As Creator He is Father to all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is spiritual Father only to believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18). He has decreed for His own glory all things that come to pass (Ephesians 1:11). He continually upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His sovereignty He is neither author nor approver of sin (Habakkuk 1:13; John 8:38-47), nor does He abridge the accountability of moral, intelligent creatures (1 Peter 1:17). He has graciously chosen from eternity past those whom He would have as His own (Ephesians 1:4-6); He saves from sin all who come to Him through Jesus Christ; He adopts as His own all those who come to Him; and He becomes, upon adoption, Father to His own (John 1:12; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews 12:5-9).</p>
	
	<a name="godtheson"><h4>God the Son</h4></a>
	<p>We teach that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, possesses all the divine excellencies, and in these He is coequal, consubstantial, and coeternal with the Father (John 10:30; 14:9). We teach that God the Father created “the heavens and the earth and all that is in them” according to His own will, through His Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things continue in existence and in operation (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17; Hebrews 1:2). We teach that in the incarnation (God becoming man) Christ surrendered only the prerogatives of deity but nothing of the divine essence, either in degree or kind. In His incarnation, the eternally existing second person of the Trinity accepted all the essential characteristics of humanity and so became the God-man (Philippians 2:5-8;Colossians 2:9). We teach that Jesus Christ represents humanity and deity in indivisible oneness (Micah 5:2; John 5:23; 14:9-10; Colossians 2:9). We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ was virgin born (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23, 25; Luke 1:26-35); that He was God incarnate (John 1:1, 14); and that the purpose of the incarnation was to reveal God and to redeem men (Psalm 2:7-9; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:29; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 7:25-26; 1 Peter 1:18-19). We teach that, in the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity laid aside His right to the full prerogatives of coexistence with God, assumed the place of a Son, and took on an existence appropriate to a servant while never divesting Himself of His divine attributes (Philippians 2:5-8). We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through the shedding of His blood and sacrificial death on the cross, and that His death was voluntary, vicarious, substitutionary, propitiatory, and redemptive (John 10:15; Romans 3:24-25; 5:8; 1 Peter 2:24). We teach that on the basis of efficacy of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, the believing sinner is freed from the punishment, the penalty, the power, and one day the very presence of sin; and that he is declared righteous, given eternal life, and adopted into the family of God (Romans 3:25; 5:8-9; 2 Corinthians 5:14-15; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18). We teach that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead and that He is now ascended to the right hand of the Father, where He now mediates as our Advocate and High Priest (Matthew 28:6;Luke 24:38-39; Acts 2:30-31; Romans 4:25; 8:34; Hebrews 7:25; 9:24; 1 John 2:1). We teach that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave, God confirmed the deity of His Son and gave proof that God has accepted the atoning work of Christ on the cross. Jesus` bodily resurrection is also the guarantee of a future resurrection life for all believers (John 5:26-29; 14:19; Romans 1:4; 4:25; 6:5-10; 1 Corinthians 15:20, 23). We teach that Jesus Christ will return to receive the church, which is His body, unto Himself at the rapture and, returning with His church in glory, will establish His millennial kingdom on earth (Acts 1:9-11; 1Thessalonians 4:13-18; Revelation 20). We teach that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one through whom God will judge all mankind (John 5:22-23): Believers (1 Corinthians 3:10-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10); Living inhabitants of the earth at His glorious return (Matthew 25:31-46); and Unbelieving dead at the Great White Throne (Revelation 20:11-15). As the mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5), the head of His body the church (Ephesians 1:22; 5:23; Colossians 1:18), and the coming universal King who will reign on the throne of David (Isaiah 9:6; Luke 1:31-33), He is the final judge of all who fail to place their trust in Him as Lord and Savior (Matthew 25:14-46; Acts 17:30-31).</p>
	
	<a name="godtheholyspirit"><h4>God the Holy Spirit</h4></a>
	<p>We teach that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, eternal, underived, possessing all the attributes of personality and deity including intellect (1 Corinthians 2:10-13), emotions (Ephesians 4:30), will (1 Corinthians 12:11), eternality (Hebrews 9:14), omnipresence (Psalm 139:7-10), omniscience (Isaiah 40:13-14), omnipotence (Romans 15:13), and truthfulness (John 16:13), In all the divine attributes He is coequal and consubstantial with the Father and the Son (Matthew 28:19; Acts 5:3-4; 28:25-26; 1Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; and Jeremiah 31:31-34with Hebrews 10:15-17). We teach that it is the work of the Holy Spirit to execute the divine will with relation to all mankind. We recognize His sovereign activity in creation (Genesis 1:2), the incarnation (Matthew 1:18), the written revelation (2 Peter 1:20-21), and the work of salvation (John 3:5-7). We teach that a unique work of the Holy Spirit in this age began at Pentecost when He came from the Father as promised by Christ (John 14:16-17; 15:26) to initiate and complete the building of the body of Christ, which is His church (1 Corinthians 12:13). The broad scope of His divine activity includes convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment; glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ, and transforming believers into the image of Christ (John 16:7-9; Acts 1:5; 2:4; Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18;Ephesians 2:22). We teach that the Holy Spirit is the supernatural and sovereign agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13). The Holy Spirit also indwells, sanctifies, instructs, empowers them for service, and seals them unto the day of redemption (Romans 8:9, 2Corinthians 3:6; Ephesians 1:13). We teach that the Holy Spirit is the divine teacher Who guided the apostles and prophets into all truth as they committed to writing God`s revelation, the Bible. Every believer possesses the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit from the moment of salvation, and it is the duty of all those born of the Spirit to be filled with (controlled by) the Spirit (John 16:13;Romans 8:9; Ephesians 5:18; 2 Peter 1:19-21; 1 John 2:20,27). We teach that the Holy Spirit administers spiritual gifts to the church. The Holy Spirit glorifies neither Himself nor His gifts by ostentatious displays, but He does glorify Christ by implementing His work of redeeming the lost and building up believers in the most holy faith (John 16:13-14; Acts 1:8; 1Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 3:18). We teach, in this respect, that God the Holy Spirit is sovereign in the bestowing of all His gifts for the perfecting of the saints today and that speaking in tongues and the working of sign miracles in the beginning days of the church were for the purpose of pointing to and authenticating the apostles as revealers of divine truth, and were never intended to be characteristic of the lives of believers (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 13:8-10; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 4:7-12; Hebrews 2:1-4).</p>
